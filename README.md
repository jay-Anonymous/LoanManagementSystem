# Loan Management system 


## Installing

```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose run app
```

## Running the tests

There are three types of tests :  <br />
1. Setup test :- These tests correspond to all the setup of dummy data  (login and registrations are checked here)
2. Security tests :  These test are responsible for conducting cross account actions that is to see role based acces of api point <br />
  * eg :- Customer shouldn't access admin roles etc.
3. Api tests : These correspond to whether all the api are working fine and aren't returing unexpected things

<strong>NOTE :Setup tests can only be run once , as the dummy data can't be inserted again due to primary key restrictions</strong>

```
$ docker-compose exec app python project/tests/tests_setup.py -----> Run at the first (only one time)
$ docker-compose exec app python project/tests/tests_security.py
$ docker-compose exec app python project/tests/tests_api.py
```
```
To test again from start and empty the database :-

$ docker-compose exec app python manage.py recreate_db

```
